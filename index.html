	<h2>The Number of Murders in Each State</h2>

	<p>Throughout the U.S., the number of murders in 2019 ranges from the less than 10 to well above 1,000. The state with the most murders was California, and the state with the least murders was Florida, according to the avilable data. However, it is important to recognize that three of the states, Illinois, Florida, and Alabama, only had limited data available for 2019. The actual number of murders for these states may be higher. When not including these states with limited data, Vermont had the least amount of murders.</p>
